This is a demo application in order to showcase the functionalities of the Dialogflow Essential tool.

It is a framework supported by Google Cloud Platform that enables us to design a basic chatbot.

This framework is used to create a ChatBot and is integrated with a Spring Boot Application.

Thus,when the localhost url of the spring boot appication is hit, the browser will direct to a page that will ask for a username.

Once the username is given one can start chatting with the Bot.
